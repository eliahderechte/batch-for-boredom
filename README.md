# batch-for-boredom
Batch script I made just for fun. I tried to make use cmd only, but I eventually ran out of ideas, so I decided to use python as well. 

It is a batch file so it obviously only works for Windows systems.
It is nothing supercool, I started it when I began learning batch and continued working on it until now.
I am okay with the comeout, but it's still far away from satisfying me.
I'll try to give updates and newer versions of this weekly.
