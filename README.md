# batch-for-boredom
Batch script I made just for fun. I tried to make it cmd only, but I eventually ran out of ideas, so I decided to use python as well. 

It is a batch file so it obviously only works for Windows systems.
It is nothing supercool, I started it when I began learning batch and continued working on it until now.
I am okay with the comeout, but it's still far away from satisfying me.
I'll try to give updates and newer versions of this weekly.

All tools except 13, 14, 15, 18 (python) work without any additional installations.
To use these tools, you need to install Python3.10 and the required modules. 
To do so just launch the script via controls.bat and goto 16 and install it.


## Installation:

```
git clone https://github.com/eliahderechte/batch-for-boredom
cd batch-for-boredom
control.bat
```
