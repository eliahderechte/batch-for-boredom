# batch-for-boredom
Batch script I made just for fun. I tried to make it cmd only, but I eventually ran out of ideas, so I decided to use python as well <br/>

It is a batch file so it obviously only works for Windows systems. <br/>
It is nothing supercool, I started it when I began learning batch and continued working on it until now. <br/>
I am okay with the comeout, but it's still far away from satisfying me. <br/>
I'll try to give updates and newer versions of this weekly. <br/>

All tools except 13, 14, 15, 18 (python) work without any additional installations. <br/>
To use these tools, you need to install Python3.10 and the required modules. <br/>
To do so just launch the script via control.bat and goto 16 and install it. <br/>


## Installation & usage:

```
Open a new Terminal
git clone https://github.com/eliahderechte/batch-for-boredom
cd batch-for-boredom
control.bat
```

### Installation Python and required Modules:
Go to Number 16 in the Mainmenu <br/>
Enter 'py' first <br/>
After installing Python from the Microsoft Store go back <br/>
Now Enter 'modules' <br/>
Don't worry about some error messages, it should still work without any problems <br/>



## Compability
It should be working on Windows 10, 8 and 7 without major problems, due to simple coding and not using complex commands which were added later on. <br/>
There may be partially malfunctions, but all in all, it should be working. <br/>


## Requirements
- Python3.10 and required Modules for Tool Nr. 13, 14, 15, 18 (inclueded in the clone, you can install these in control.bat)<br/>
- Git (required for cloning, or you can just Download the .zip if you want to, however, git is going to be more convenient)
