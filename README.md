# batch-for-boredom
Batch script I made just for fun. I tried to make it cmd only, but I eventually ran out of ideas, so I decided to use python as well. 

It is a batch file so it obviously only works for Windows systems.
It is nothing supercool, I started it when I began learning batch and continued working on it until now.
I am okay with the comeout, but it's still far away from satisfying me.
I'll try to give updates and newer versions of this weekly.

All tools except 13, 14, 15, 18 (python) work without any additional installations.
To use these tools, you need to install Python3.10 and the required modules. 
To do so just launch the script via control.bat and goto 16 and install it.


## Installation:

```
git clone https://github.com/eliahderechte/batch-for-boredom
cd batch-for-boredom
control.bat
```

### Installation Python and required Modules:
Go to Number 16 in the Mainmenu <br/>
Enter 'py' first <br/>
After installing Python from the Microsoft Store go back <br/>
Now Enter 'modules' <br/>
Don't worry about some error messages, it should still work without any problems <br/>



## Compability
It should be working on Windows 10, 8 and 7 without major problems, due to simple coding and not using complex commands which were added later on. <br/>
There may be partially malfunctions, but all in all, it should be working. <br/>
